    <h2>I don't think there is anyone who doesn't like pizza and this recipe does not make an exception</h2>
    <p>This classic pizza dish recipe has a nice crunchy crust with flavorful toppings, including pineapple that has a
        slight smokey flavor.</p>
    <p>Although the name might suggest Polynesian origins, Hawaiian pizza has Canadian beginnings. In the 60s, you could
        find delicious ham and pineapple topped pies at Satellite Restaurant in Chatham, Ontario. The cook, Sam
        Panopoulos, had the fruit on hand and wanted to introduce more diverse flavors on traditional menu items to
        customers. <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.ca/article/the-history-of-hawaiian-pizza/">Here is the source</a></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for pan</li>
        <li>2 slices applewood-smoked bacon</li>
        <li>4 canned pineapple rings</li>
        <li>1 pound fresh pizza dough, at room temperature</li>
        <li>½ cup pizza sauce (from 1 [14-oz.] jar)</li>

        <li>2 cups (8 oz.) pre-shredded whole-milk mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup thinly sliced red onion</li>
        <li>3 ounces Canadian bacon (about 4 slices), cut into 1-in. triangles</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C) with a rack in the lower position. Oil a large rimmed
            baking sheet with olive oil.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium-high. Add bacon and cook, flipping occasionally, until golden
            brown and crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. </li>
        <li>Pour out pan drippings without wiping pan clean, and return skillet to heat. Add pineapple, cook until
            lightly browned and caramelized, 3 minutes per side. Remove from pan. Chop bacon and cut pineapple rings
            into 3/4-inch pieces. </li>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll dough to a 12-inch circle and place on the oiled baking sheet. Prick
            dough with a fork several times to reduce air bubbles. Spread pizza sauce evenly over dough, leaving a 1
            1/2-inch border around edges. Sprinkle with cheese, onions, Canadian bacon, pineapple, and chopped bacon.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbly, toppings are lightly charred, and crust is golden
            brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Let stand 5 minutes before serving. </li>
    </ol>
